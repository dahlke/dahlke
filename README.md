### Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Neil.

Enterprise software veteran with a lot left to learn. Raised in Chicago, living in San Francisco. Feel free to approach me - Iâ€™m always up for a chat. If you donâ€™t know where to start, ask me about: data, cloud infrastructure, skiing, music, or basketball. I suspect we'll find common ground.
