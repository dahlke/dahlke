### I'm Neil.

Enterprise software veteran with a lot left to learn. Raised in Chicago, living in San Francisco. Feel free to approach me - I'm always up for a chat. If you don't know where to start, ask me about: LLMs, agents and evals, observability, data systems, cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, durable execution, skiing, music, team sports, or golf. I suspect we'll find common ground.
